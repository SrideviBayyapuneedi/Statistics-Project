Analysis of factors affecting the birth of low weight babies

According to WHO, a baby is considered to be of low weight if it weighs less than 5 pounds 8 ounces at birth (2500 grams). Low baby birth weight is a major concern in United States because of its high mortality rate and a higher probability of leading to serious medical conditions. The goal of this analysis is to identify risk factors associated with the mother of giving birth to a low birth weight baby. We considered factors such as age, weight, race, hypertension, uterine irritability, premature labor history, smoking status and number of physician visits.

From the analysis, we observe that the mother’s weight at her last menstrual period is positively correlated with baby birth weight. Any medical conditions like hypertension and uterine irritability have a negative impact on baby birth weight. Smoking is also found to have an impact on baby birth weight and is found to be lesser for babies of mothers who smoke. Further analysis showed that the mean baby birth weight is the least for African American mothers compared to those belonging to white and other races.

Finally, we conclude that the mother’s behavior rather than her physical characteristics has a higher impact on the baby’s birth weight.
